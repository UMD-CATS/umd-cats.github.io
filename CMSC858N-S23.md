# Scalable Parallel Algorithms and Data Structures
*CMSC858N: Spring 2023*


**Time and Location:** Tuesday/Thursday, 2--3:15pm, CSI 2107

**Instructor:** [Laxman Dhulipala](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~laxman/) (IRB 5150)
### Course Description

This is a research-oriented course on parallel algorithms.
The main goal is to develop a rigorous understanding of parallel algorithm design and analysis.
The later parts of the course will study a variety of applications which can benefit from fast, scalable, and theoretically-efficient parallel implementations.

This course qualifies as a theory concentration requirement.

**Prerequisites:** 
You should be comfortable with algorithm design and analysis (e.g., you should be comfortable with the material from CMSC451).
Prior experience with C++ will be helpful, but you should be able to pick up everything you need to know during this course.
