I am a second year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Guy Blelloch][guy] with whom I work with on parallel algorithms both in theory and in practice. 

I am running a [reading group][rg] on parallel algorithms this semester.
