title: Parallelism Reading Group
---

The goal of this reading group is to learn about parallelism, concurrency and distributed computing in depth.

We are interested in many aspects of these areas, from programming-languages and systems to parallel algorithms and graph processing. If you have a paper that fits under this broad umbrella, we would probably be interested in reading it.

You can join our mailing list [here][ml]. If you are interested in presenting, please contact [Laxman Dhulipala][ldh].

**Time and Place:** We meet on Wednesdays at 4:30 pm in GHC 9115.
