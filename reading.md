title: Parallelism Reading Group
---

The goal of this group is to read interesting papers in the areas of parallelism, concurrency and distributed computing. We're interested in a broad range of topics, from programming-languages and systems to parallel algorithms and graph processing.

You can join our mailing list [here][ml].
