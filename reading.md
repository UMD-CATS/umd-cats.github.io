title: Parallelism Reading Group
---

Goal: The goal of this reading group is to learn in significant depth about parallelism, concurrency and related areas. We're not just interested in algorithms---if you have a programming-language or systems paper related to these areas, we would probably be very intersted in reading it. 

Time and Place: We meet at 4:00pm on Thursdays. Room information will be sent out shortly.
