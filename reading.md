title: Parallelism Reading Group
---

Goal: The goal of this reading group is to learn in significant depth about parallelism, concurrency and related areas. We're not just interested in algorithms---if you have a programming-language or systems papers related to these areas, we would likely be very intersted in discussing it. Talks should be fairly informal and interactive---questions are highly encouraged. 

Time and Place: We meet at 4:00pm on Thursdays. Room information will be sent out shortly.
