I enjoy biking, running, and hiking. I also enjoy playing the piano.

Here's some ongoing reading from during lockdown which I enjoyed:

* Bullshit Jobs (David Graeber); currently reading
* The Culture Series (Iain Banks); currently reading Use of Weapons
* Being Mortal (Atul Gawande)
* The Rings of Saturn (W.G. Sebald)
* How to Write a Thesis (Umberto Eco); interesting insights into how research was conducted before the internet, and the advice is still valuable. Best read when starting graduate school :-)
* Bad Blood (John Carreyrou)
* The Buried Giant (Kazuo Ishiguro)
* Sea of Fertility 1--3 (Yukio Mishima); books 1 and 2 are incredible, need to seriously attempt the last book
* Valley of Genius (Adam Fischer)
