I enjoy biking, running, and hiking. I also enjoy playing the piano.

Here are some books that I read and enjoyed recently:

* Making of the Atomic Bomb
* Jeeves and the King of Clubs (Schott; impossible to replicate Wodehouse but this was surprisingly good)
* A Confederacy of Dunces (Toole)
* Klara and the Sun (Ishiguro)
* Evolution (Baxter)
* The Ministry for the Future (Robinson)
* Blood Music (Bear)
* Being Mortal (Gawande)
* The Rings of Saturn (Sebald)
* How to Write a Thesis (Eco); interesting insights into how research was conducted before the internet, and the advice is still valuable. Best read when starting graduate school :-)
* The Buried Giant (Ishiguro)
* Sea of Fertility (Mishima); still haven't read the fourth book
