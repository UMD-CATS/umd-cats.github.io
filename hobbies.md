I enjoy biking, running, and hiking. I also enjoy playing the piano.


Here are some books that I read and enjoyed recently. If you have any
recommendations please let me know!

* If This is a Man / The Truce
* Defying Hitler: A Memoir
* Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta
* Making of the Atomic Bomb
* A Confederacy of Dunces
* Klara and the Sun
* The Ministry for the Future
* Blood Music
* Being Mortal
* The Rings of Saturn
* How to Write a Thesis; interesting insights into how research was conducted before the internet, and the advice is still valuable. Best read when starting graduate school :-)
* The Buried Giant
